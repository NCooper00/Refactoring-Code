# Refactoring-Code
Refactor existing code to improve it's accessibility without changing what it does.



## Semantic HTML

I went through the html code and added semantic html elements so that the code is easier to understand.



## CSS Optimization

I then went through the css and optimized any section that had the same effects applied by combining them into one: 

>*line 90:* [.benefit-lead, .benefit-brand, .benefit-cost]

>*line 101:*  [.benefit-lead img, .benefit-brand img, .benefit-cost img]

>*line 108:* [.search-engine-optimization, .online-reputation-management, .social-media-marketing]

>*line 118:* [.search-engine-optimization img, .online-reputation-management img, .social-media-marketing img]

>*line 123:* [.search-engine-optimization h2, .online-reputation-management h2, .social-media-marketing h2]



## QOL in CSS

I added comments above the code I changed to describe it's function in the css.
